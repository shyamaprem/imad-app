                This is my first time working with Node.js and I ran into this problem:
            </p>
            <p>
                I have started a Node server through the plugin of an IDE. Unfortunately, I cannot use the IDE's terminal. So I tried to run the script from the command line.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the problem - I am using the Express module and my app is listening some port (8080). When I start the app from the command line, it throws this error:
                
            </p>
                
        </div>
